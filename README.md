# 🎨 One Shot Idea

Build UI ideas and visual concepts by prompting LLMs, almost in one shot, in less than an hour.

## What is this?

**One Shot Idea** is a small creative project and hobby.

Everything here is **vibecoded** (100% written with AI). This includes the code, commit messages, idea names, descriptions, and even this README.

Every idea here is created using a single detailed prompt (with minimal tweaks if needed) and finished within less than an hour. Some ideas are functional, some are purely visual, and some are incomplete. That is intentional.

The goal is speed, intuition, and exploration, not polish.

## Why?

A few years ago, I moved away from UI work and focused heavily on backend systems and infrastructure, and more recently on hardware and AI. I never stopped building, but I drifted away from designing interfaces.

The urge to create visually never disappeared. I still notice interfaces, layouts, and random visual ideas and feel the need to try them out.

Modern LLMs make this easy again. They are surprisingly good at turning vague visual ideas into working interfaces through language and vibe driven coding.

This project exists to spend time with UI again, without pressure or overthinking.

## The challenge

Every third day, I build one idea:

- Simple or complex
- Functional or purely visual
- Original, inspired by something I saw, or a quick clone

The rules are simple:
- Almost one shot
- Less than an hour
- Ship whatever exists at the end

## Tools

I use different models and tools to experiment and compare results.

So far:
- Claude Code
- Gemini via AI Studio
- Cursor


Planned or in progress:
- Replit
- Codex with GPT
- v0
- Other tools and models

## Notes

- For the first 30 ideas, code quality does not matter.
- After idea 50, I will publish the prompt, model, and tool used.
- For the first 50 ideas, everything is fully client side. No APIs and no backend.
- Some ideas are unfinished. That is expected.
- The project is open source.
- I use Next.js because I am comfortable with it and it lets me move fast.

## Philosophy

This project is not about clean code or architecture.

It is about training visual taste, sharpening creative instincts, and learning to see the world as a continuous visual feed. I believe taste is a skill, and like any skill, it improves with repetition.

I cannot draw and my handwriting is bad, but I have always felt there is an artist with good taste inside me. LLMs act as a proxy for that taste, letting me turn visual intuition and instinct into something tangible, purely through my ability to communicate clearly with a machine.
